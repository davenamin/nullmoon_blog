It's time for a change. I really like [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) and
enjoyed seeing the transition to version 1.0 and beyond. Ghost is a
product to rival WordPress and other blogging platforms, and this
isn't a prolific site -- after four years I've ended up with about a
post a year (and half of my posts have languished in half-completed
'draft' status!)

A couple of my friends (and a non-trivial portion of the greater
Internet) have been using static sites for some time
now. [Gabe](http://students.cs.uri.edu/~gdepace/) happily showed me
his student page a couple of years ago, and it was refreshing to see
that I can understand the contents of 'View Page Source' just as well
as the final rendered product! Paul introduced me to
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) via the [Newport Data
Project](http://newportdataproject.org/) which uses [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

A huge attraction to Ghost was the Markdown editor along with access
to third-party themes -- I don't know much about CSS and that's
unlikely to change soon. But there are many ways to skin a cat, which
is why I'm switching to [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). Same ability to
author posts in Markdown today, with options to use [version control
tools](https://git-scm.com/) that I'm familiar with to track changes
and eventually switch to writing in [org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) or
leveraging the incredible [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/).

In the meantime, however, I'm happy to also play around with web tools
that I think could be useful for future posts. This switch gave me the
chance to discover and experiment with \\(\KaTeX\\) as well!
