It's going to be a great year.

Err, every year I come up with a stack of _side projects_ that I get
very excited about. Over 90% of the time they go nowhere. I have
several intelligent and enthusiastic friends who occasionally fall
into the same rut. We have a group stack which holds more grandiose
ideas.

Fortunately, every once in a while, something from one of the stacks
gets off the ground. This time the _side project_ is a collaborative
one.

Our merry band has a plan to celebrate a successful calibration. A
grandiose plan, if you will. A foray into the burgeoning world of
self-backed currency.

I give you an artistic interpretation of the soon-to-be-minted **Joe
Dollar**. Stay tuned.
